The right number of epochs depends on your goal:

🔍 Quick test / debug	1–5	Fast run, just to verify setup and output

🧪 Visualize accuracy vs epsilon	5–15	Shows tradeoff: more epochs = higher accuracy but higher ε

📊 Privacy budget focus	3–10	Keeps ε lower while showing some model learning

🎓 Training for real performance	15–30	Pushes accuracy up (but ε increases too)


📊 Final Results: DP vs Non-DP
Metric	Differentially Private Model	Baseline Model (No DP)
Accuracy	91.91%	97.86%
Privacy Budget (ε)	1.28	❌ None (public risk)
Noise Multiplier	1.1	N/A
Epochs	15	15
Dataset	MNIST	MNIST
🔍 Takeaway
You traded ~6% accuracy for strong privacy guarantee
(ε = 1.28).

This shows DP is practical — especially in settings like healthcare, finance, or user data apps where privacy is a must.

🔐 What is Differential Privacy (DP)?
Differential Privacy is a mathematically rigorous framework that adds statistical noise to data or model training in a way that protects any individual's presence in the dataset — even against adversaries with background knowledge.

🧮 What is ε (Epsilon) — the Privacy Budget?
Think of ε as:
A “budget” for how much information your model is allowed to “leak” about any single individual.

Lower ε = strong privacy, more noise, less accuracy

Higher ε = better accuracy, weaker privacy

Analogy:
Imagine an app answering queries about a population. With DP:

Low ε: Answers are fuzzy, protecting privacy

High ε: Answers are sharp but reveal more

💡 Why Does the Privacy Budget Matter?
Concern	How Privacy Budget Helps
Regulatory Compliance	Helps meet GDPR, HIPAA, and CPRA “data minimization” & privacy-by-design requirements
Risk Reduction	Even if model weights are leaked, DP mathematically guarantees no individual can be confidently reconstructed
Trust & Transparency	You can quantify and report your privacy loss (e.g., “ε = 1.2 over 15 epochs”)
🛡️ What are the Risks Without DP?
Model inversion attacks can reconstruct training data (e.g., faces, health info).

Membership inference attacks can reveal if a specific person was in the dataset.

These are more likely in overfit models trained on sensitive or small datasets.

🎯 When Should We Use Differential Privacy?
You're training on sensitive data (medical, financial, location, etc.)

You want provable privacy guarantees vs. heuristic obfuscation

You need to satisfy compliance audits (DP is increasingly recommended in government/health sectors)
